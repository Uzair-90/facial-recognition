# Facial Expression Recognition using Transfer Learning

This project demonstrates how to create a facial expression recognition model using transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture. The model 
is trained to classify facial expressions into six different categories: Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

## Introduction

Facial expression recognition is an interesting and challenging problem in the field of computer vision. This project demonstrates how to 
build a robust facial expression recognition model using a pre-trained deep learning architecture. Transfer learning is employed to leverage 
the knowledge from the pre-trained model for the specific task of facial expression classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images categorized into six different facial expression classes:
- Angry
- Fear
- Happy
- Neutral
- Sad
- Surprise

The dataset is organized into directories, with each directory corresponding to one of the facial expression classes.
